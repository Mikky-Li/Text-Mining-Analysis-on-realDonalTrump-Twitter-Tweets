# Text-Mining-Analysis-on-realDonalTrump-Twitter-Tweets-Using-Tweepy

This is a Text Mining project on @realDonaldTrump Twitter Tweets from 1/11/2020 to 1/17/2020. The projects include several parts:

1. I will create a word cloud of @realDonaldTrump Tweets from 1/11/2020 to 1/17/2020 to see which words are commonly used in his Tweets. I firstly applied Twitter API and then used Tweepy to get @realDonaldTrump Tweets. Then I used NLTK to split sentence to words and delete stopwords. Finally WordCloud package is used to create word cloud. 

2. I will use sentiment analyzer from NLTK to get the score of @realDonaldTrump Tweets emotion from 1/11/2020 to 1/17/2020 and visualize it using Plotly 

3. Using Quanteda package in R to create a matrix of word usage and predict label of each Tweets based on the word usage using Keras and Naive Bayes.
